# Week-11

# Labs: reusable components
This week you'll build some reusable components. We suggest that you split up in pairs for this and select one component each, so that you could build as many components as possible in your team, and then share them with each other! 

<Header />
<Footer />
<Button />
<ProfileImage />
<SearchBar />
<Card />
<CookieAlert />
<Loader />

Create the component and style it according to the designs ['https://www.figma.com/file/TvzlqGmdny9sJEBz82MwX9/Components-Design-Layouts---Technigo?node-id=0%3A1']. Make it take in props so it becomes reusable. Such as <Header title="Welcome to my site" /> You can build and store them in CodeSandbox or on Github. Try the component you've built out with passing different props to it and see how it changes. What parts could be dynamic and what parts works best as static?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
